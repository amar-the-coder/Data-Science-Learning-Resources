 Flow charts:
To understand the flow of the program

Pseudo Code:
1. It is the set the instructions that we want to carry out to program something in a certain language. 
2. Pseudo codes will not have any set syntax of any language
3. It is available to make the humans understand the Business Logic that programmer is going to implement

Pseudo Code Examples:
********************************

1. Create a program to add 2 numbers together and then display the result
	Start Program
	Enter the number 1, n1
	Enter the second number, n2
	Add the two numbers, n1, n2
	Display the result	
	End Program

2. Compute the area of a rectangle
	Start Program
	Enter the length, l
	Enter the width, w
	Calculate the area = l * w
	Display the area	
	End Program

3. Display if the candidate has passed or failed in the exam; given passing marks as 60
	Start Program
	Enter the marks, m1
	Check for the condition, m1 >= 60
	If condition output is True
		print passed
..mm	otherwise
		print failed
	End Program

4. Write a table of a given number
	Start Program
	Enter the number, num
	Set the counter to 1, Set end value to 10 
	Start the loop
		save the result = num * counter
		display the result
		increment the counter by 1
	End the loop
	End Program
