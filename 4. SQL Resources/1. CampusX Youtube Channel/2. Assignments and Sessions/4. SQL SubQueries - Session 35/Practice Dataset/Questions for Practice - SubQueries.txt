SQL SubQuery---(Just For Knowledge)
How to load the dataset(s) to SQL?
Using Python, you can load the large datasets to MySQL database very easily. For that follow the below steps.

First create a database in your local machine server.
CREATE DATABASE <database_name>
Next, use Python to load the database
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

df = pd.read_csv("file/path/to/the/database.csv")

engine = create_engine("mysql+pymysql://<db_username>:<db_password>@<hostname>/<database_name>")
df.to_sql("<table_name>", con=engine)
